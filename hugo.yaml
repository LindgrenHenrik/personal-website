    content: |-
      I'm a Control Systems Engineer with a passion for developing innovative and efficient solutions. My background in Electrical and Mechanical Engineering, combined with my hands-on experience at Volvo Cars, has equipped me with a strong foundation in control theory, data analysis, and software development.

      I thrive on tackling complex challenges, as demonstrated by my work on designing and implementing control strategies for next-generation electric vehicles and developing a fully automated data infrastructure. I'm driven by a desire to optimize systems and improve product quality, and I'm always eager to explore new technologies and methodologies.

      Outside of work, I enjoy diving into personal projects, such as building a home server and creating a Discord image generation bot, which allows me to expand my skills and explore new areas of interest.
